# Earthquake and Tectonic Plates Visualization

This repository contains a project that aims to visualize earthquake data in relation to the location of tectonic plates on Earth. The project was inspired by an interest in exploring earthquake patterns and their relationship with tectonic plate boundaries.

## Project Overview

The project presents earthquake data on an interactive map, highlighting:

1. Earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.
2. The location of tectonic plates in relation to earthquake data.
3. An interactive map that combines the above data to provide a comprehensive view of the relationship between earthquakes and tectonic plates.

## How to Use

To explore the earthquake and tectonic plate visualization, simply navigate to the project folder and open the appropriate HTML file in your web browser. The interactive maps will allow you to zoom in and out, as well as click on individual data points for more information.
